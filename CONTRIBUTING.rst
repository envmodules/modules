Developer notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

See the :ref:`design` for recent feature specifications. Some development
howtos are also available:

* :ref:`add-new-sub-command`
* :ref:`add-new-config-option`

.. _running-the-tests:

Running the tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Run the basic test suite with::

   make test

This only runs the tests for the current environment. `GitHub Actions`_ and
`Cirrus CI`_ will run the full suite when you submit your pull request.

There are more than 17 000 test cases thus it generally takes around 12
minutes to run the full test suite. It can be executed in *quick* mode to just
run the most essential tests in about 1 minute::

   make test QUICKTEST=y

The :command:`script/mt` utility is also available to just execute one or
several testfiles. If a test fails, :command:`script/mt` reports the *diff*
comparison between expected and actual results. For instance, to only
execute :file:`testsuite/modules.50-cmds/470-variant.exp` testfile, run::

   script/mt 50/470

Run :command:`script/mt` with ``--help`` option to get usage details and
syntax to select several testfiles.

.. _GitHub Actions: https://github.com/envmodules/modules/actions
.. _Cirrus CI: https://cirrus-ci.com/github/envmodules/modules

.. _running-test-coverage:

Running test coverage
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Generating a report of lines that do not have test coverage can indicate where
to start contributing or what your tests should cover for the code changes you
submit.

Run ``make test COVERAGE=y`` which will automatically setup the `Nagelfar`_
Tcl code coverage tool in your ``modules`` development directory and
instrument the source Tcl scripts. Then the full testsuite will be run in
coverage mode and an annotated script will be produced for each Tcl script in
``tcl`` source directory (``tcl/*.tcl_m``)::

   make test COVERAGE=y
   # then open tcl/*.tcl_m files and look for ';# Not covered' lines

The :command:`script/mt` utility may also be used to run the test suite in
coverage mode on full testsuite or on a few testfiles::

   script/mt cov 70/{280,290}

.. _Nagelfar: http://nagelfar.sourceforge.net/

Running linter tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Linter tools check code syntax and report issues and good practices to follow.
Modules uses `Nagelfar`_ to check syntax of Tcl scripts and `ShellCheck`_ to
lint sh, bash and ksh scripts.

Run ``make testlint`` to lint all sh, bash, ksh and Tcl scripts in your local
Modules repository.

The :command:`script/mt` utility may also be used to run the full *lint* test
suite or just specific testfiles. For instance to only lint Tcl scripts::

   script/mt lint 00/030

.. _ShellCheck: https://www.shellcheck.net/

Check performances
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The :command:`script/mb` utility checks from your local repository the
performances of major releases of Modules and current branch. Current ongoing
modifications are first stashed, then :command:`modulecmd.tcl` of the
releases and current branch are built. Different tests are run against each
version and the execution time of each test is reported in millisecond::

   $ script/mb
             |   v4.1.4 |   v4.3.1 |   v4.5.3 |   v4.7.1 |   v5.1.1 |     main |
   ----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+----------+
        help |        9 |       12 |       12 |       15 |       16 |       16 |
       avail |       61 |       67 |       76 |       82 |       91 |       86 |
      avail2 |       11 |       16 |       19 |       21 |       23 |       23 |
      avail3 |        - |        - |        - |      120 |      128 |      130 |
      whatis |      208 |      155 |      233 |      216 |      221 |      224 |
     whatis2 |       10 |       15 |       17 |       20 |       21 |       22 |
     whatis3 |        - |        - |        - |      287 |      307 |      314 |
     apropos |      208 |      153 |      222 |      210 |      220 |      223 |
        load |       66 |       87 |      134 |      162 |      120 |      126 |
        list |       24 |       23 |       33 |       22 |       25 |       25 |
      unload |       46 |       24 |       25 |       29 |       31 |       31 |

It helps to verify that current work committed in local repository does not
impact performances on simple test scenarios. Run :command:`script/mb` with
``--help`` option to get its usage details.

The ``profile`` mode may also be interesting to learn what are the internal
procedures of :command:`modulecmd.tcl` taking most of the execution time for
each test::

   script/mb profile

Building the docs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Build the docs in the ``doc`` directory using Sphinx::

   cd doc
   make html

Open ``_build/html/index.html`` in your browser to view the docs.

Read more about `Sphinx`_.

.. _Sphinx: https://www.sphinx-doc.org

.. _coding-conventions:

Coding conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Maximum line length is 78 characters
* Use 3 spaces to indent code (do not use tab character)
* Adopt `Tcl minimal escaping style`_
* Procedure names: ``lowerCameCase``
* Variable names: ``no_case_at_all``
* Curly brace and square bracket placement::

   if {![isStateDefined already_report]} {
      setState already_report 1
   }

* `No trailing space nor misspelling <commit-hooks_>`_

.. _Tcl minimal escaping style: https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/Tcl+Minimal+Escaping+Style

.. _developer-certificate-of-origin:

Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to ensure that all contributions are properly authorized and in
compliance with licensing requirements, Modules project follows the `Developer
Certificate of Origin (DCO)`_ process. The DCO is a lightweight mechanism to
certify that you, as a contributor, have the right to submit your code and
agree to the projectâ€™s licensing terms.

How to sign off your commits
""""""""""""""""""""""""""""

Every commit must include a ``Signed-off-by`` line, which certifies that the
contribution adheres to the DCO. You can do this by adding the following line
at the end of your commit message::

    Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.email@example.com>

The name and email must match your Git configuration (``git config user.name``
and ``git config user.email``).

To simplify the process, you can use the ``-s`` flag of ``git`` command when
committing::

    git commit -s -m "Your commit message"

Verifying DCO Compliance
""""""""""""""""""""""""

Modules repository automates checks to enforce the DCO. If your contribution
does not include the proper ``Signed-off-by`` line, the pull request check
will fail. You will need to amend your commit::

    git commit --amend -s

.. _Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO): https://developercertificate.org/

.. _commit-hooks:

Commit hooks
~~~~~~~~~~~~

A :command:`pre-commit` hook script is provided in the :file:`script`
directory of the project to help you check that the contribution made is free
of misspellings and trailing spaces. It requires the `codespell`_ utility that
checks for typos in any kind of files and the `Hunspell`_ utility that spell
checks documentation files. The :command:`pre-commit` could be enabled in your
local repository with following command::

   ln -s ../../script/pre-commit .git/hooks/pre-commit

A :command:`commit-msg` hook script is also provided in the :file:`script`
directory of the project to help you check that your commit messages are free
of misspellings. It requires the `Hunspell`_ utility and could be enabled in
your local repository with following command::

   ln -s ../../script/commit-msg .git/hooks/commit-msg

.. _codespell: https://github.com/codespell-project/codespell
.. _Hunspell: https://hunspell.github.io/

Emacs settings for coding conventions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an example Emacs configuration that adheres to the first two
coding conventions.  You may wish to add this to your ``.emacs`` or
``.emacs.d/`` to modify your tcl-mode::

   (add-hook 'tcl-mode-hook
      (lambda ()
        (setq indent-tabs-mode nil)
        (setq tcl-indent-level 3)
        (setq tcl-continued-indent-level 3)
        (font-lock-add-keywords nil '(("^[^\n]\\{79\\}\\(.*\\)$" 1
                                       font-lock-warning-face prepend)))))

Submitting installation recipes
-------------------------------

* If you want to share your installation tips and tricks, efficient ways you
  have to write or organize your modulefiles or some extension you made to the
  ``module`` command please add a recipe to the cookbook section of the
  documentation.
* Create a directory under ``doc/example`` and put there the extension code
  or example modulefiles your recipe is about.
* Describe this recipe through a `reStructuredText`_ document in
  ``doc/source/cookbook``. It is suggested to have an *Implementation*,
  an *Installation* and an *Usage example* sections in that document to get
  as much as possible the same document layout across recipes.
* `Submit a patch <submitting-patches_>`_ with all the above content.
